    <h1>HYBRID SLAM</h1>
    <p>HybridSLAM is an approach to SLAM which combines
the strengths and avoids the weaknesses of two popular mapping strategies:
FastSLAM and EKF-SLAM. FastSLAM is used as a front-end, producing local maps
which are periodically fused into an EKF-SLAM back-end. The use of FastSLAM
locally avoids linearisation of the vehicle model and provides a high level of robustness
to clutter and ambiguous data association. The use of EKF-SLAM globally
allows uncertainty to be remembered over long vehicle trajectories, avoiding Fast-
SLAM’s tendency to become over-confident. Extensive trials in randomly-generated
simulated environments show that HybridSLAM significantly out-performs either
pure approach. The advantages of HybridSLAM are most pronounced in cluttered
environments where either pure approach encounters serious difficulty. In addition,
the HybridSLAM algorithm is experimentally validated in a real urban environment

<br>
<br>
When the environment is modelled as a discrete set of features, each described
by a number of continuous state variables. The standard solution is
to take a Bayesian approach, explicitly modelling the joint probability distribution
over possible vehicle trajectories and maps.
<br>
<h3>There are currently two</h3>
popular approaches to modelling this distribution. The first is to linearise and
represent the joint probability with a single high-dimensional Gaussian. This
is the approach taken by EKF-SLAM and its variants . The second is
to use a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter, representing the vehicle’s trajectory
using a set of particles and conditioning the map on the vehicle’s trajectory.
Examples of this approach include FastSLAM.

<br>
<h3>Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses</h3>
<br>
The EKF is prone to failure where significant vehicle uncertainty induces linearisation
errors , or where significant clutter induces ambiguity in data association.
The latter issue is problematic because the standard EKF formulation requires
that hard data association decisions be made, by selecting the most likely
hypothesis. Once a bad association is made it cannot be un-done and can
cause the filter to fail catastrophically .
The probability of making a potentially-catastrophic incorrect decision
can be reduced by using batch association methods. Nearest-neighbour association
considers each observation in isolation, under the assumption that
landmarks are independent. Joint compatability (e.g. JCBB  improves robustness
by simultaneously considering all observations made from a single
pose, but cannot consider relations between observations made from different
poses. Sliding-window methods simultaneously consider all observations made
from poses in a small window of recent history, but can be computationally
intractible without the assumption of landmark independence for multiple
observations from a single pose.
In contrast to the EKF, FastSLAM does not suffer from linearisation problems
(because it does not linearise the vehicle pose), and is much more robust
in situations of association ambiguity. For data association, each particle is
allowed to make independent decisions, hence FastSLAM can maintain a probability
distribution over all possible associations. As more observations
arrive, particles which made poor association decisions in the past tend to be
removed in the resampling process, hence the majority of particles tend to
converge to the correct set of associations. For the purposes of data association,
FastSLAM automatically allows information to be integrated between
observations at a single time step (as JCBB does), and between multiple time
steps (as sliding-window methods do). The former occurs due to landmarks
being conditionally-independent given the vehicle path, the latter due to each
particle’s memory of past associations. Furthermore, FastSLAM is simple to
implement relative to complicated batch association algorithms.
The disadvantage of FastSLAM is its inability to maintain particle diversity
over long periods of time . The fundamental problem is that the particle
filter is really operating in a very high-dimensional space: the space of vehicle
trajectories (not momentary poses). The number of particles needed is therefore
exponential in the length of the trajectory. When a smaller number is
used, the filter underestimates the total uncertainty, and eventually becomes
inconsistent. While this may still produce good maps, problems are encountered
when the full uncertainty is required, for example when large loops need
to be closed.
<br>
<h4>A hybrid mapping strategy combines the
strengths of both approaches</h4>. We advocate the use of FastSLAM as a frontend
to an EKF-SLAM back-end. The FastSLAM front-end is used to build
local maps, and is allowed to run for long enough to disambiguate associations.
Before the trajectory length becomes so long that particle diversity becomes
problematic, a single Gaussian is computed from the FastSLAM posterior.
This Gaussian local map is then fused into the global map. At the point of
fusion, a hard decision must be made about the associations between localmap
features and global-map features. However, a large local map can provide
sufficient constraints to make the probability of a bad decision extremely low.
The result is a SLAM algorithm which is robust to linearisation errors and
data association ambiguities on a local scale, and can also close large loops
on a global scale.
